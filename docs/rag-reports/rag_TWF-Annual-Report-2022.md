**Per-document runtime (s):** 2222.54

## Summary
The document is a limited assurance report on the sustainability disclosures of Turkiye Varlik Fonu (TWF) for the year ended December 31, 2022. The report was prepared by an independent assurance provider who performed procedures to obtain evidence about the Selected Information. The procedures included inquiries, analysis of key processes and controls, evaluation of source data, re-performance of calculations, and limited substantive testing.

The report concludes that nothing has come to the attention of the assurance provider that causes them to believe that the Group's Selected Information is not properly prepared in all material respects in accordance with the Reporting Principles. The report also notes that a limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement.
