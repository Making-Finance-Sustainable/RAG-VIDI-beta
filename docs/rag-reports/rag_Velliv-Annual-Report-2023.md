## Summary
Velliv's annual report for 2023 highlights a historically high profit of DKK 930m after tax, with a return on equity of 22.5%. The company's gross written premiums remained at a high level of DKK 34.1bn, and regular premiums increased by 11% to DKK 15.7bn. Velliv also reported a satisfactory customer development, with a continued solid flow of new customers and extended agreements with existing corporate customers.

In terms of responsible investments, Velliv joined the Paris-Aligned Investment Initiative (PAII) and had its climate targets approved under the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). The company divested approximately DKK 4bn in fossil extraction companies that do not support the objectives of the Paris Agreement. Additionally, Velliv structured a new bond type with the World Bank to finance green transition and social sustainability projects in developing countries.

The report also highlights Velliv's efforts to balance its health and accident business, with over 1,000 customers participating in a program to prevent and shorten the course of illness. However, the result was negatively affected by the establishment of a risk margin in the health and accident business and regulation of benefits under disbursement.
