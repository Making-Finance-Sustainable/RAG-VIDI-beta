# Analysis for `PERSI-Annual-Report-2023.md`

**Per-document runtime (s):** 338.938

## Summary
The document is a financial report for the Public Employee Retirement System of Idaho as of June 30, 2022. The report includes audited financial statements and supplementary information. The auditor expressed an unmodified opinion on the financial statements, indicating that they are consistent with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.

The report provides comparative information for the year ended June 30, 2022, but notes that this information does not include sufficient detail to constitute a presentation in conformity with accounting principles. Therefore, it should be read in conjunction with the System's basic financial statements for the same period.

The document also includes a discussion and analysis section, which serves as an introduction to the System's financial statements. This section is comprised of four components: fund financial statements, notes to financial statements, required supplementary information, and additional supplementary schedules.

Additionally, the report includes exhibits that provide further related information, such as summary actuarial assumptions and methods, schedule of active member valuation data, and composite returns on investments.

The document also features images, including a solid teal color graphic, a photo of colleagues in a meeting, and a solid blue rectangle. However, these images do not appear to be directly related to the financial information presented in the report.

Key metrics and targets are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, the report mentions that composite returns are the target weighted returns of the asset class benchmarks.
