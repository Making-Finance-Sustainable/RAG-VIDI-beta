## Summary
Here is a concise summary of the document in 200-300 words:

This report presents summarized comparative information for the year ended June 30, 2022. The financial statements are prepared using the accrual basis of accounting and include prior-year summarized comparative information in total but not by fund. The System's financial statements have been audited, and an unmodified opinion was expressed on those statements.

The report includes a summary of significant accounting policies, including the use of estimates and the capitalization of assets with a unit cost of $5,000 or greater. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method with estimated useful lives of 3 to 40 years.

The Group Life Insurance program is supported by premiums paid by its participants and by reserves, which are maintained in an investment portfolio. The increase in portfolio value over the period is attributable to positive investment return and positive cash flow.

Management's discussion and analysis (MD&A) provides a narrative introduction, overview, and analysis of the basic financial statements. The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.

The report also includes information on funding of System programs, capital assets, administrative expenses, and risks and uncertainties.
