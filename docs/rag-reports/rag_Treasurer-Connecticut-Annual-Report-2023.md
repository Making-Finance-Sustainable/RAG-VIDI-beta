The report includes financial statements and supplementary information for various funds administered by the Office of the Treasurer, including the Second Injury Fund, Non-Civil List Trust Funds, and Combined Investment Funds.

The report notes that the financial statements are intended to present only the funds and accounts administered by the Office of the Treasurer and do not purport to present fairly the financial position of the State of Connecticut.
