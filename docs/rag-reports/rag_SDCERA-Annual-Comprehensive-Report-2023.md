The San Diego County Employees Retirement Association (SDCERA) has released its Annual Comprehensive Financial Report for 2023. The report includes audited financial statements, which were previously audited and received an unmodified opinion on November 9, 2022. The report also includes a summary of comparative information as of June 30, 2022.

The report provides historical perspective and detail on SDCERA's FY 2023 financial statements, note disclosures, and supplementary information. It is divided into two major categories: Financial Trends Information and Operating Information.

The Actuarial Section of the report discusses the valuation assumptions used in the June 30, 2023 valuation, which were adopted by the Retirement Board based on the June 30, 2021 Triennial Actuarial Experience Study. The report also includes a discussion and analysis (MD&A) section, which provides an overview of SDCERA's financial performance.

The auditor's report expresses an opinion that the summarized comparative information presented in the report is consistent with the audited financial statements. However, it notes that the other information included in the report, such as the introductory, investment, actuarial, and statistical sections, is not covered by the audit opinion.
