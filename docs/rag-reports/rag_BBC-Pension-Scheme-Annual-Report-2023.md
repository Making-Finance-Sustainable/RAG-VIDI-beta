**Per-document runtime (s):** 390.386

## Summary
Here is a concise summary of the document in 200-300 words:

The document is an independent auditor's report on the financial statements of the BBC Pension Scheme for the year ended March 31, 2023. The auditor, Deloitte LLP, has examined the evidence and concluded that the contributions reported in the summary of contributions have been paid at least in accordance with the Schedule of Contributions.

The Trustee is responsible for preparing and reviewing the Schedule of Contributions and monitoring whether contributions are made to the Scheme by the employer in accordance with the Schedule. The auditor's responsibility is to provide a statement about contributions paid under the Schedule of Contributions and to report their opinion to the Trustee.

The report highlights that the value of the Scheme's assets was significantly lower compared to the previous year, largely due to falls in the value of liability matching bonds. The total number of Scheme beneficiaries at March 31, 2023, was 45,416 (excluding dependants), a decrease of 1.8% from the previous year.

The auditor has concluded that the Trustee's use of the going concern basis of accounting is appropriate and has not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Scheme's ability to continue as a going concern for at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorized for issue.
