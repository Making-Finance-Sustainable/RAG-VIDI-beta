## Summary
Temasek Holdings has developed a 10-year roadmap, T2030 strategy, to guide its strategic planning, capability building, and institutional development initiatives. The strategy is anchored by the company's purpose and underpinned by three foundational enablers: catalytic capital, networked organisation, and purpose, culture, values. Temasek aims to deliver sustainable value over the long term and has identified six top-of-mind issues challenging the economic environment.

The company has set a target of net zero emissions by 2050 and has implemented various initiatives to reduce its carbon footprint. It also focuses on constructing a resilient and forward-looking portfolio that can withstand exogenous shocks and market volatility while focusing on sustainable growth over the long term.

Temasek's organisational risk management framework includes risk return appetite statements, which set out various levels of risk tolerance, and is supported by specialised teams who report to senior management. The company embeds risk management in its systems and processes, including approval authority delegation, company policies, standard operating procedures, and risk reporting to the board and board risk & sustainability committee.

Key metrics include:

* Carbon emissions: 27 million tCO₂e (2023), with a target of 11 million tCO₂e by 2030
* Net zero emissions ambition by 2050
