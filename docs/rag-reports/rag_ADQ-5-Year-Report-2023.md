## Summary
ADQ is an investment and holding company that operates in key sectors of the transforming economy of Abu Dhabi. The company has a comprehensive approach to sustainable development and economic contribution, with six core strategic objectives: making a positive impact on communities, generating sustainable financial returns for stakeholders, enhancing people's quality of life, supporting government priorities, contributing to decarbonization, and strengthening UAE resilience through supply chain localization.

ADQ established its Sustainable Finance Framework in September 2023, which sets out eligible categories with environmental and/or social benefits. The framework was assigned a high rating by Moody's Investors Service. The company has also developed an ESG strategy and adopted a rating methodology to understand ADQ's ESG position and quantify its ESG performance.

ADQ's roadmap includes implementing its strategy with overarching priorities, including establishing a baseline strategy and plan, implementation, continuous improvement, and measurement against long-term ESG targets. The company is collaborative in its approach, agile in embracing change, and accountable for its actions.

ADQ's impact extends beyond its portfolio, as it deploys capital to support broader socioeconomic goals. The company has launched two publications: "Foundation for Prosperity: The Contributing Role of Sovereign Wealth Funds in Laying the Building Blocks for Economic Growth" and a second publication launched in October 2023.
