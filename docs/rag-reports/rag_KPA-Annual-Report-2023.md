### Adjustment log
- Removed 'Two people are smiling while carrying large, colorful boxes labeled with Swedish text and icons representing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.' as it does not directly relate to net zero or decarbonization. The image is more about sustainable development in general.
- Added 'våra egna utsläpp ska ner till nettonoll år 2030' as evidence for both net zero and decarbonization, since it states the goal of achieving net zero emissions from our own operations by 2030.
