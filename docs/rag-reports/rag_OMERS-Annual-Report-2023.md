## Summary
The OMERS Administration Corporation (AC) and OMERS Sponsors Corporation (SC) have released their 2023 Annual Report, which includes a Management's Discussion & Analysis (MD&A) section. The MD&A provides an overview of the OMERS Pension Plans' financial condition, investment results, risk management, approach to sustainable investing, and the environment in which the plans operate.

The report highlights five key areas: attendance at Board and Committee meetings, primary plan funding, managing plan design and funding risks, risk governance, and RCA funding. The MD&A also includes a review of relevant documents and records to reconcile select performance metrics data for a limited sample of assets.

The AC follows Canadian accounting standards for pension plans, as outlined in the Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada (CPA Canada) Handbook Section 4600. The consolidated financial statements include the financial position, changes in net assets available for benefits, and changes in pension obligations of AC and the OMERS Pension Plans.

The report also includes a summary of significant accounting policies, basis of presentation, and auditor's responsibilities. The auditors evaluated the overall presentation, structure, and content of the consolidated financial statements, including disclosures, to ensure fair presentation.

Key metrics and targets mentioned in the report include:

* Primary Plan Funding: 93.4% (as at December 31, 2023)
* RCA Funding: 104.1% (as at December 31, 2023)

Actions taken by the AC and SC Boards of Directors include reviewing and approving the contents of the MD&A, as well as evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates.
