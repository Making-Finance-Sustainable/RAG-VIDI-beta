The Foundation Industry-wide Pension Fund for the Retail Sector is a mandatory industry-wide pension fund that administers pension schemes for employees in the retail sector. The foundation aims to fulfill its obligations towards participants and pension beneficiaries in accordance with statutes, legislation, and conditions arising from mandatory participation. During an audit, particular attention was paid to areas related to specific activities of the foundation and laws and regulations for pension funds. The foundation has outsourced various administrative tasks.

The Retail Pension Fund is a young fund with high turnover, and every year tens of thousands of people start and stop building up their pension. To draw attention to pensions, new participants receive a special edition of Jij&Wij Magazine. Since 2020, the fund has produced a short annual overview in addition to legally required annual accounts, aiming to make complex information accessible.

The board reports on its policy in the management report, and is accountable for the outcomes achieved from this policy. The audit report describes matters unless prohibited by law or regulation.
