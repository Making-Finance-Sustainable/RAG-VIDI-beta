The report also discusses the importance of legislating an objective for the superannuation system, which would provide stability and confidence to policymakers, regulators, industry, and the community.

Furthermore, it highlights the importance of tax concessions and the need for greater equity in the system, supporting the proposed policy to reduce tax concessions for people with total superannuation balances over $3 million.

Overall, the report provides an overview of AustralianSuper's commitment to its members, its strategy for growth and sustainability, and its support for policies that promote a fair and equitable superannuation system.
