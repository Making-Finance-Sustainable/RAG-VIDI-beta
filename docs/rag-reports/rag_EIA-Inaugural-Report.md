## Summary
The Emirates Investment Authority (EIA) is a federal-level sovereign wealth fund established in 2007 to manage investments across multiple economic sectors, asset classes, and geographies. The EIA's core objective is to achieve long-term sustainable prosperity for the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and its people. The organization has evolved significantly since its inception, with a focus on strategic assets and asset management.

The EIA has established a formal three-stage investment process, consisting of pre-screening, Investment Committee review, and final decision-making by the Executive Committee. The investment portfolio approach is divided into two distinct groups: Strategic Assets and Asset Management.

The organization has also launched an Intern Leadership Program (ILP), which provides participants with hands-on experience in various fields, including private equity, asset management, treasury, and special projects. The ILP aims to develop skills and provide exposure to different investments and sub-industries.

As a trusted advisor to the Federal Government, the EIA has played an important role in shaping federal economic and industrial policies. The organization is committed to achieving its mandate and contributing to the long-term prosperity of the UAE.
