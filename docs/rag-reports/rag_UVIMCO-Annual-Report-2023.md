## Summary
The University of Virginia Investment Management Company (UVIMCO) has released its annual report for 2023, highlighting the performance of its Long Term Pool. The pool's annualized returns over 5, 10, and 20 years were 10.1%, 9.8%, and 10.0%, respectively, outperforming the Policy Portfolio and TUCS All Master Trust Universe Median. The report also provides an asset allocation breakdown, showing that the Long Term Pool is composed of 56% University-Associated Organizations and 44% University Other Long-Term Assets, with a total value of $266.6 million.

The report notes that UVIMCO's investment strategy focuses on maximizing long-term, inflation-adjusted returns commensurate with the risk level of the University. The company's Chief Executive Officer/Chief Investment Officer, Robert Durden, emphasizes the importance of resilience in withstanding challenging years and sticking to the investment strategy.

The report also provides a historical asset allocation chart, showing how the policy portfolio has shifted over time. Equity dominates the portfolio, while Fixed Income & Cash declines from 25% to 7%. Private Equity and Long/Short Equity have grown significantly, increasing from 11% to 26% and 15% to 27%, respectively.

In terms of investment performance, UVIMCO's Long Term Pool gained 2% in fiscal year 2023, underperforming the policy portfolio benchmark. The report attributes this underperformance to outsized exposures to emerging markets, particularly China, and the failure of developed market managers to fully capture strong gains seen in domestic equities.
