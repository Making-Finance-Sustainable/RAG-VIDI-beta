## Summary
Here is a concise summary of the document:

The document appears to be an annual report for OCERS, a pension system, which includes financial statements and supplementary information. The report was prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) guidelines. The independent auditor's report expresses an unmodified opinion on the financial statements, but notes that the required supplementary information is not audited and does not express an opinion or provide any assurance on it.

The report includes a statement of changes in fiduciary net position, investment returns, and other information such as actuarial and statistical sections. The investment consultant's statement provides additional information on investment performance.

Key metrics include:

* Annualized rates of return for different asset categories over various time periods ended December 31, 2023
* Composite returns of all manager portfolios within each asset class, net of fees

Targets and actions are not explicitly stated in the document, but it appears that the report is intended to provide transparency and accountability on the financial performance of OCERS.
