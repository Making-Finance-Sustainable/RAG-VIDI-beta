## Summary
Here is a concise summary of the document in 200-300 words, focusing on material facts, metrics, targets, and actions.

The New York State Teachers' Retirement System (NYSTRS) has released its financial statements for the years ended June 30, 2023, and 2022. The report includes an overview of the system's activities, financial highlights, and a discussion and analysis of its financial performance. The system's funding progress is also presented, showing a slight improvement in the funded ratio from 94.4% to 95.1%.

The actuarial certification letter provides an opinion on the system's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. The report also includes statistical information, such as demographic and economic data, to provide context and assist users in understanding the system's financial position.

The management discussion and analysis section highlights key areas, including investments, actuarial assumptions, and funding progress. The report notes that the system's assets have increased by 10.3% from $123.4 billion to $136.1 billion as of June 30, 2023.

The independent auditor's report expresses an unqualified opinion on the fairness of the financial statements in all material respects. However, it also highlights certain supplementary schedules that are not part of the basic financial statements but are intended to provide additional information.

* Funded ratio: 95.1% (2023) vs. 94.4% (2022)
* Assets: $136.1 billion (2023) vs. $123.4 billion (2022)
* Actuarial present value of future benefits: $143.8 billion (2023) vs. $134.9 billion (2022)
