# Analysis for `Electricty-Supply-Pension-Annual-Report-2023.md`

**Per-document runtime (s):** 274.917

## Summary
The document appears to be a section from an annual report and financial statement of a pension scheme. The text discusses the actuarial liabilities of the scheme, but the majority of the content is missing due to repeated headings. However, it mentions that the conclusion about the scheme's ability to continue as a going concern is not a guarantee, as future events or conditions cannot be predicted.

The document also distinguishes between the financial statements and "other information" in the annual report, stating that the auditor's opinion only covers the financial statements and not the other information. The Scheme Trustee is responsible for the other information.

Key metrics and targets are not explicitly mentioned in this section of the document.
