# Analysis for `Strathclyde-Annual-Report-2023.md`

**Per-document runtime (s):** 411.41

## Summary
The Strathclyde Pension Fund's climate change strategy involves assessing the impact of different climate-related scenarios on its liabilities, assets, and operating costs. The fund has undertaken scenario analysis to estimate the impact of temperature rises equivalent to 2°C, 3°C, and 4°C above preindustrial times. The results are illustrated in a chart showing four overlapping bell-shaped curves representing different funding level distributions under each scenario.

The fund's risk management process involves identifying, analyzing, assessing, responding to, monitoring, and reporting risks. A risk tolerance matrix is used to profile each risk, and the distribution of risks recorded in the SPF register as at 31st March 2023 is shown.

The fund has concluded that the use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of its financial statements is appropriate, with no material uncertainties identified that may cast significant doubt on its ability to continue to adopt this basis for a period of at least twelve months.

Key metrics and targets include:

* Funding level distributions under different climate-related scenarios
* Risk scores amended as required based on regular review of the risk register
* Customer engagement and satisfaction targets agreed in the annual business plan, with results reported annually
