## Summary
The New Jersey State Investment Council's 2023 Annual Report provides an overview of the council's investment activities and performance during fiscal year 2023. The report highlights the challenges faced by the global economy, including rising prices, inflation, and geopolitical concerns. Despite these challenges, the U.S. economy and consumer sentiment remained resilient.

The report notes that the Investment Grade portfolio had slight relative outperformance due to its credit spreads tightening more than the benchmark. The U.S. Treasuries portfolio also outperformed due to tactical duration positioning. However, macro strategies, such as macro-systematic funds, experienced losses from short positions in equities.

The Division is evaluating the Risk Mitigation Strategies portfolio structure to improve downside protection and enhance liquidity while reducing fees. The report also provides an overview of the International Equity Portfolio's performance compared to a custom benchmark index, showing outperformance across most sectors.

Key metrics include:

* Total Pension Fund return vs. benchmark: not specified
* U.S. Treasuries portfolio outperformance: attributed to tactical duration positioning
* Investment Grade portfolio relative outperformance: due to credit spreads tightening more than the benchmark
* Macro strategies performance: negative, with losses from short positions in equities
