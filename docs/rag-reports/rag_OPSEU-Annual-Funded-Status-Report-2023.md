**Per-document runtime (s):** 365.392

## Summary
The 2023 Funded Status Report (FSR) of OPTrust provides a comprehensive overview of the organization's financial performance, responsible investing activities, and progress towards its strategic goals. The report includes an auditor's opinion on the fairness of the financial statements, which were found to be free from material misstatement. The FSR highlights areas where OPTrust can prioritize engagement for strengthening portfolio sustainability, such as supporting external partners in setting net-zero emissions targets and improving diversity within investment teams.

Key metrics and targets include:

* A minority of external partners have set a net-zero emissions target
* Investment team composition is far from gender parity or fully representative of individuals from underrepresented groups
* The Plan valuation uses best estimate assumptions with the exception of the discount rate, which includes a margin of conservatism

Actions taken by OPTrust include:

* Integrating responsible investing content within the FSR to ensure members and stakeholders can easily view activities and understand how considerations are incorporated into investments
* Supporting external partners in improving diversity within investment teams
* Continuing to advocate for inclusive and equitable organizations
