## Summary
The Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation's (APFC) Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) provides an overview of the financial activities of the Alaska Permanent Fund (Fund or Permanent Fund) for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023, and June 30, 2022. The MD&A is divided into three sections: financial highlights, discussion regarding use of the financial statements, and analysis of the financial statements.

The Balance Sheets present all assets, liabilities, and fund balances of the Fund as of June 30, 2023, and June 30, 2022. Assets are grouped into broad categories for ease of readability and analysis. The Statements of Revenues, Expenditures, and Changes in Fund Balances present the financial activity of the Fund over the 12 months in FY2023 and FY2022.

The Financial Statement Analysis section provides an analysis of past fiscal years' activities and specific contributors to changes in the net assets of the Fund. The fund balance serves as a gauge of the financial strength of the Fund. While assets of the Fund exceeded liabilities each year by double-digit ratios, the nonspendable fund balance is unavailable for appropriation.

The Notes to the Financial Statements are an essential element to fully understanding all financial aspects of the Fund and interpreting the major components of the financial statements.
