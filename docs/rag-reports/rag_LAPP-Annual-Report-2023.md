**Per-document runtime (s):** 396.653

## Summary
The Local Authorities Pension Plan (LAPP) financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, provide information about the net assets available to meet future benefit payments. The plan defines its capital as the funded status and aims to ensure full funding over the long term through investment management, contribution rates, and benefits. The plan's investments use derivatives and leverage based on an asset mix and risk policies designed to meet or exceed the long-term funding requirement within an acceptable level of risk.

The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with Canadian Accounting Standards for pension plans and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for accounting policies not related to investment portfolio or pension obligation. The plan's auditor has expressed an opinion that the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the net assets available in the plan to meet future benefit payments.

Key metrics include:

* Investment returns
* Change in net assets
* Pension obligation
* Per cent of pension obligation supported by net assets

The plan's management and those charged with governance are responsible for the financial statements. The auditor has evaluated the appropriateness of accounting policies, reasonableness of accounting estimates, and related disclosures made by management.
