## Summary
Here is a concise summary of the document in 200-300 words:

The document describes the procedures performed by Ernst & Young (EY) in a limited assurance engagement for Ilmarinen's sustainability reporting. The engagement aimed to provide a conclusion on whether the subject matter was presented in accordance with the criteria, but did not provide reasonable assurance due to its limited scope. EY's procedures included updating their knowledge of Ilmarinen's material sustainability topics, interviewing personnel responsible for gathering and consolidating data, assessing the subject matter from internal and external sources, and checking data on a sample basis.

The document also mentions that Ilmarinen plans to prepare a Human Rights Impact Assessment in 2023. Additionally, it describes EY's bottom-up approach to quantifying historical and forward-looking climate-related risks for listed securities, which involves analyzing carbon footprint data and normalizing it using financial indicators.

EY conducted the engagement in accordance with International Standard for Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information (ISAE 3000 Revised) and the terms of reference agreed with Ilmarinen. The nature, timing, and extent of the procedures selected depended on EY's judgment, including an assessment of the risk of material misstatement.
