**Per-document runtime (s):** 355.732

## Summary
The document appears to be an auditor's report on the sustainability disclosures of Industriens Pension, a Danish pension fund. The auditors performed various procedures to assess the risk of material misstatement in the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) metrics disclosed by the company.

The auditors made inquiries and conducted interviews with group functions, checked ESG metrics against underlying documentation, and evaluated the presentation of ESG metrics in the annual report. They also assessed the actuarial methods and models applied by the company and tested the calculation of provisions for insurance and investment contracts on a sample basis.

Based on their procedures, the auditors concluded that nothing came to their attention that would cause them to believe that the ESG metrics were not prepared in accordance with the specified methods. However, they noted that their conclusion was limited to providing "limited assurance" regarding the ESG metrics.

The report also includes various tables and schedules, including a breakdown of investment assets and financial liabilities by valuation, as well as information on risk management and accounting policies.
