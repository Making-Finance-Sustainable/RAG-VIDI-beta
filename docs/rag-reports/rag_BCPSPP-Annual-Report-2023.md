## Summary
The Public Service Pension Plan (Plan) has released its annual report for 2023, which includes financial statements and notes to the financial statements. The report provides an overview of the Plan's investments, investment results, risk management, responsible investing, and managing investment costs. The auditor's report expresses an opinion that the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Plan as at March 31, 2023.

The Plan's objective for managing capital is to ensure that its assets are invested prudently and effectively, with contributions adequate to meet its obligations. The Board has a funding policy that outlines principles for managing this process. Funding deficits must be funded over a period not to exceed 15 years.

Key metrics include:

* The Plan's funded status (surplus or deficit) as determined by the actuary
* Member and employer contribution rates
* Investment performance of the Plan's assets compared to relevant industry benchmarks

Actions taken by the Board include:

* Reviewing investment performance on a regular basis
* Adjusting member and employer contribution rates
