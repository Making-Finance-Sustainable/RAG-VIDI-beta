The Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) has published its second mandatory Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) report, which provides an assessment of climate-related risks and opportunities. The report highlights USS's Net Zero ambition and its efforts to manage climate change risks through governance structures, asset allocation, and ESG integration. The report also includes key findings on realised return, funding measures, and asset allocation performance.

USS has adapted its governance structures to incorporate oversight of the scheme's climate strategy, with the Trustee Board having ultimate responsibility for managing climate-related risks and opportunities. The report provides an assessment of how USSIM is delivering versus the scheme's Net Zero ambition and integrating ESG factors into investment decisions.

The report also includes a review of the Statement of Investment Principles (SIP) and the Default SIP, which outlines how key activities and decisions have followed these principles during the year.
