## Summary
Here is a concise summary of the document in 200-300 words:

The document contains an independent auditor's statement about contributions to the Trustee of the UK Shell Pension Plan. The auditors, Ernst & Young LLP, have examined the summary of contributions for the plan year ended December 31, 2023, and found that contributions have been paid at least in accordance with the Payment Schedule dated June 2019.

The audit scope included an examination of evidence relevant to the amounts of contributions payable to the Plan and the timing of those payments under the Payment Schedule. The auditors also assessed the susceptibility of the Plan's financial statements to material misstatement, including the risk of management override of controls.

The document includes various charts and graphs illustrating the UK Shell Pension Plan's investment strategies, including the Default Lifestyle Strategy and the Annuity Lifestyle Strategy. These charts show how retirement savings are allocated across different phases and how investment allocations shift over time as individuals approach retirement.

The auditors' statement is made solely to the Plan's Trustee, as a body, in accordance with regulation 4 of the Occupational Pension Schemes (Requirement to obtain Audited Accounts and a Statement from the Auditor) Regulations 1996. The auditors do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Plan's Trustee for their audit work, report, or opinions.
