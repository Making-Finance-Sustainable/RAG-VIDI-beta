## Summary
Here is a concise summary of the document:

Vasakronan's Sustainability Report covers the Parent Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries for the year 2023. The report has been prepared pursuant to the Swedish Annual Accounts Act Chapter 6 Section 11 and encompasses pages 87-135. Ernst & Young AB (EY) conducted a limited assurance engagement on the report, which can be found on page 136.

The report includes an overview of Vasakronan's operations, sustainability targets, and notes on financial, environmental, and social responsibility. The Board of Directors is responsible for preparing the Sustainability Report, including the Statutory Sustainability Report.

Key metrics include:

* Tax profit for the year: SEK 2,774 (Group) and SEK 246 (Parent Company)
* Current tax: SEK -341 (Group) and SEK -106 (Parent Company)
* Deferred tax: SEK 3,115 (Group) and SEK 352 (Parent Company)

The auditor's limited assurance report concludes that nothing has come to their attention that causes them to believe the Sustainability Report is not prepared in accordance with the criteria defined by the Board of Directors and Executive Management.
