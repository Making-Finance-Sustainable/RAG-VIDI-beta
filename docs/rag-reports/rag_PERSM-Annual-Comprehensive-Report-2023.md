The Public Employees' Retirement System (PERS) has released its annual report, which includes financial statements and supplementary information.

The current benefit structure is outlined in the Actuarial Section, with no changes since the last valuation.

The report also includes a summary of main system provisions as interpreted for valuation purposes, valuation assets, and funding progress. Additionally, it provides schedules of funding progress over the last 10 fiscal years, solvency tests, analysis of financial experience, and schedules of active member valuation data and retirees added to and removed from rolls.

The report is intended to provide extensive and reliable information as a basis for making management decisions, determining compliance with legal provisions, and determining responsible stewardship for the assets contributed by the system's members and employers. The report is available on the PERS website.
