**Per-document runtime (s):** 436.54

## Summary
The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has been working on key sustainability initiatives, building on its refreshed Finance for Net Zero (FiNZ) Action Plan launched in April 2023. The plan expands the scope of MAS' Green Finance Action Plan to include transition finance, which is vital for funding infrastructure and technology required to decarbonize the economy.

In the past year, MAS has implemented various aspects of its strategy to identify, assess, and manage climate risks and opportunities. This includes scenario analysis that references multiple scenarios across a wide range of plausible outcomes to understand and analyze the potential impact of climate change on portfolio risks and returns.

MAS has also published consultation papers on transition planning for banks, insurers, and asset managers, which set out expectations for financial institutions (FIs) to engage with their customers and investee companies, adopt mitigation and adaptation strategies, and contextualize potential short-term increases in emissions by taking a multi-year view in financing activities backed by credible transition plans.

The MAS has also co-chaired an NGFS blended finance initiative, which published a Technical Document on Scaling Up Blended Finance for Climate Mitigation and Adaptation in Emerging Market and Developing Economies (EMDEs).

Key metrics include:
