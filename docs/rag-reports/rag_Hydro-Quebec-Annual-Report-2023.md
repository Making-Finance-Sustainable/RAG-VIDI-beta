## Summary
Here is a concise summary of the document:

The document presents the results of an audit of Hydro-Québec's consolidated financial statements for 2023. The audit evaluated the overall presentation, structure, and content of the financial statements, as well as the disclosures made by management. The audit also considered the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates.

The document reports that there were 36 disclosures received by the designated officer under Section 25 of the Act, with 13 being well-founded and concluded in 2023. These disclosures related to various categories of wrongdoing, including contraventions of laws and regulations, serious breaches of ethics and professional conduct, misuse of funds or property, and gross mismanagement.

The audit opinion does not cover the other information presented in the Annual Report, which includes management's discussion and analysis. The auditors' responsibility is to read this other information and consider whether it is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or their knowledge obtained during the audit.

Key metrics and targets include:

* 36 disclosures received by the designated officer under Section 25 of the Act
* 13 well-founded disclosures concluded in 2023
* 5 disclosures related to misuse of funds or property belonging to a public body

Actions taken by management and those charged with governance include:

* Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates
